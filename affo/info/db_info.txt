We are using 8.0.19 MySQL Community Server - GPL.

The users table can be found under 'aao/users.idb'

To install the database on your local computer please navigate  to:
C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data, create a folder called 'aao',
navigate there and place all the '.ibd' files from the repo's 'aao' folder.

Type 'SHOW databases' in your MySQL terminal and you should see 'aao' under there.
